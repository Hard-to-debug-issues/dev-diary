One of our goals for the summer is to _write_ more, so we are aggressively setting up a whole new blog for our dedicated developer diary as we learn about clojure/clojurescript, framework development, and open source contribution! Super excited to start working on re-frame next week (I can't believe there's only a week left, what happened to June??)

```clojure
;; [silent screaming]
(println "hello world! \o/")
```

<3, chris & saskia

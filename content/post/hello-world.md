One of our goals for the summer is to _write_ more, so we are aggressively setting up a whole new blog for our dedicated developer diary as we learn about clojure/clojurescript, framework development, and open source contribution!

```clojure
;; [silent screaming]
(println "Hello world!")
```

<3, chris & saskia

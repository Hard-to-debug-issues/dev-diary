      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s really happening. After many months of anticipation, we&amp;rsquo;re so close to finally start working on re-frame.
Levels of excitement are raising.
Preparations are being made.
Informations are getting exchanged.
Only four more days!
It fascinates me to realize how many people put time and energy into making this experience possible. Five months ago, my job ended unexpectedly. The next day, I saw that applications for Rails Girls Summer of Code were opening.</description>

      <description>One of our goals for the summer is to write more, so we are aggressively setting up a whole new blog for our dedicated developer diary as we learn about clojure/clojurescript, framework development, and open source contribution! Super excited to start working on re-frame next week (I can&amp;rsquo;t believe there&amp;rsquo;s only a week left, what happened to June??)
